Clone a repository on Linux via a HTTP proxy
--------------------------------------------
Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/128035/how-do-i-pull-from-a-git-repository-through-an-http-proxy

$ git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.mycompany:80
Note: this was ok for RUAG. Maybe beacuse login was done before via Firefox.

Where do i put the username and password for proxy?
	
Use git config --global http.proxy http://mydomain\\myusername:mypassword@myproxyserver:8080 syntax to provide username/password  

If git push refuses with "403 Forbidden access..."
then enter in console: git remote set-url origin https://susifohn@github.com/susifohn/optimus-prime-100.git
After this you should be asked for a Password if you enter git push.
